# Ignition system with IGN1A

Wiring reference guide using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFzkFPengT8

For a 6-cylinder Toyota 7M-GTE engine, a common firing order is 1-5-3-6-2-4. To apply the video's principle of pairing cylinders that fire 180 degrees apart:

Determine 180-degree pairs:
Cylinder 1 fires. 180 degrees later, cylinder 6 fires. So, pair 1 and 6.
Cylinder 5 fires. 180 degrees later, cylinder 2 fires. So, pair 5 and 2.
Cylinder 3 fires. 180 degrees later, cylinder 4 fires. So, pair 3 and 4.
This means you would have three separate pairs of wires for the charging grounds, instead of combining them all.

Regarding wire gauge, the video states that 16-gauge wire was used for the individual coil power and ground wires (2:36). These then combine into a heavier 10-gauge wire for the main power and ground runs (4:17-4:23). This approach minimizes voltage drop to each coil.

### Installation Notes
- Use bare crimp butt connectors with proper crimping tool for secure connections
- Strip wire to proper length and crimp connectors firmly
- Cover all splices with heat shrink tubing for weatherproofing and insulation
- Install inline fuses on main power feeds for circuit protection
- Route wires away from heat sources and moving parts
- Use dual-wall heat shrink with adhesive for maximum protection in engine bay
